                <h4>2011</h4>
                <p>I started my degree in 2007 when I was only 16. Since I was a kid, I was very curious about computers, programs and videogames. I remember when I used for the first time Windows 95 and also when I navigated for the first time on the Internet with a modem. However, what I enjoyed the most was when I built my first program in Pascal. That was the main reason for me to study Systems Engineering and start my journey as a programmer.</p>

                <h4>2014</h4>
                <p>In 2013 I decided to study something completely different from my current profession and degree. While I was working, I started to perceive that I needed some management and business knowledge. While analysing user requirements, sometimes I didn't completely understand the business terminology used or how different company's departments interacted with each other. Studying this master's degree helped me to understand not only what does the user want but why they want it and how it's going to benefit the company's goals.</p>

                <h4>2019</h4>
                <p>Notwhitstanding I worked many years in IT, something was stopping me progress my career. I studied English for many years, however, I couldn't speak properly. It was not only when I lost a good job opportunity because of my lack of fluency that I decided to improve my English. Nevertheless, after trying diverse study methods, I realized that using English in my daily life and daily activities in an English-speaking country was the best method for me to improve quickly. That's how I decided to come to Dublin in March 2019 for an English interchange to study in Seda College and achieve another goal.</p>

                <h4>2021</h4>
                <p>Next to completing my English course, I decided to stay longer in Dublin. Living in a different country made me realize that not only I had to improve my English skills but also my IT skills. There are new technologies that didn't exist or weren't so common years ago. Web Development, DevOps and Cloud Computing, Big Data and Machine Learning are my main interests. I'm hoping to learn at CCT several new technologies that could help me to find better job opportunities in the future either in Dublin, Guatemala or another country.</p>
