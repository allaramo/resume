            <h2>Backup and Recovery Strategy</h2>
            <p id="summary">A backup and recovery plan should be considered and implemented in any website design. There are already different solutions offered by hosts and cloud services that help us to back up our files and databases in different period of times. A yearly, monthly and daily backups should be implemented as a backup strategy. Also, an offsite replication of our servers should be considered. This backup and recovery should be automatic and transparent for users. Different technologies like RAID configurations can allow us to write data across multiple drives increasing the redundancy and also can allow us to have parity data striping information so the data can be recovered if one of the disk fails.</p>
