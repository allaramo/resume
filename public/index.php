                <p id="summary">Iâ€™m an analytical person with great attention to detail. I look constantly for improvement opportunities and new ways to solve common problems. I love to explore and learn new technologies. I consider myself organized, ambitious, adaptable, reliable and a team player. I've had the opportunity to be part of different kinds of projects, performing different roles such as developer, analyst, dba, team leader and project manager. I'm from Guatemala and based in Dublin since 10 months. I'm hoping to find new job opportunities in this amazing country, upskill my career and meet people from different backgrounds, perspectives, and experiences in the IT field.</p>
